# Awesome Worth More Attention Deep Learning Papers 
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)
A curated list of hidden gems in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Inspired by [Awesome Deep Learning Papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers), [Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap) and so many more.

We believe that there are many papers in AI/DL that go under the radar of most readers, whether it's because there wasn't a big name author in it or the timing of the publication just wasn't right. Many lists already expose the well known and industry standard papers. But we want to broaden the list of topics within the AI domain by exploring lesser-known papers with novel ideas.
